# jump-to (WIP)
A Vimium inspired keyboard shortcut script for browsers. Highlights all clickable elements on a page, then provides shortcuts to click them so you never have to leave your keyboard again!

## Usage

Download the repo. Set up your own [Chrome extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started), to be triggered by a shortcut and run main.js.

## TODO

- Add test suite
- Add the ability to ctrl-click as a shortcut
- Provide better instructions for adding it to your browser as your own extension
- Place labelled elements so they don't collide
- Distribute labels closer to the home keys vs random letters (maybe?)

## Current example
